//! The RISC Zero zkVM's guest-side RISC-V API.
//!
//! Code that is validated by the [RISC Zero zkVM](crate) is run inside the
//! guest. In the minimal case, an entrypoint (the guest's "`main`" function)
//! must be provided by using the [entry! macro](entry). In almost all
//! practical cases, the guest will want to read private input data from the
//! host and write public data to the journal. In the simplest case, this can be
//! done with [env::read] and [env::commit], respectively; additional I/O
//! functionality is also available in [mod@env].
//!
//! ## Installation
//!
//! To build and run RISC Zero zkVM code, you will need to install the RISC Zero
//! toolchain, which can be done using the
//! [`cargo-risczero`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-risczero) tool:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo install cargo-binstall
//! cargo binstall cargo-risczero
//! cargo risczero install
//! ```
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! The following guest code[^starter-ex] proves a number is
//! composite by multiplying two unsigned integers, and panicking if either is
//! `1` or if the multiplication overflows:
//! ```ignore
//! use risc0_zkvm::guest::env;
//!
//! risc0_zkvm::entry!(main);
//!
//! pub fn main() {
//!     // Load the first number from the host
//!     let a: u64 = env::read();
//!     // Load the second number from the host
//!     let b: u64 = env::read();
//!     // Verify that neither of them are 1 (i.e. nontrivial factors)
//!     if a == 1 || b == 1 {
//!         panic!("Trivial factors")
//!     }
//!     // Compute the product while being careful with integer overflow
//!     let product = a.checked_mul(b).expect("Integer overflow");
//!     env::commit(&product);
//! }
//! ```
//! Notice how the [entry! macro](entry) is used to indicate the
//! entrypoint, [env::read] is used to load the two factors, and [env::commit]
//! is used to make their composite product publically available.
//!
//! If you encounter problems building zkVM guest code, you can see if we have a
//! known workaround for your issue by looking in our
//! [rust guest workarounds](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22rust+guest+workarounds%22)
//! tag on GitHub.
//!
//! [^starter-ex]: The example is based on the [Factors example](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/main/examples/factors).
