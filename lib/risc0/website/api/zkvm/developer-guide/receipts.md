# Receipts 101

_A brief introduction to the RISC Zero [receipt]._

## What is a receipt?

A receipt gives the results of your program along with proof that they were produced honestly.

![From Guest Code to Receipt](/diagrams/from-rust-to-receipt.png)

When you execute your [zkVM application], the output of your application is included in a [receipt].
The [receipt] serves as a succinct [validity proof] for the [execution] of your application.
Receipts can be passed to third parties and [verified] in order to cryptographically attest to the validity of your application's output.

<!-- The following text is duplicated from the definition of "receipt" on the terminology page.-->

The receipt consists of a [journal] and a [seal].
The journal attests to the public outputs of the program, and
the seal is the opaque blob that cryptographically attests to the validity of the receipt.

<!-- End receipt definition. -->

## How are receipts used?

Suppose Alice and Bob have agreed on some computation that needs to get done.
In particular, they've agreed on some zkVM [guest program], and they each have access to the source code and the [Image ID] for that guest program.
(In practice, Bob may retrieve the Image ID either by constructing it himself or retrieving it from a trusted channel.)

Alice runs the zkVM to generate a receipt, and then Alice sends the receipt to Bob.
After receiving the receipt, Bob can:

- inspect the receipt to extract the [journal]
- [verify] the receipt to ensure that:
  - the [execution] was valid, and
  - the [guest program] that executed was consistent with the expected [image ID].

## Extracting the Journal

The [journal] contains the public outputs of the computation.
Users can extract the journal from a receipt using [receipt.journal].

## Verifying a Receipt

[Verifying] the receipt provides cryptographic assurance that the [journal] was created honestly using the [guest program] with the expected [Image ID].
Users can verify the receipt using [receipt.verify()].

## Serializing and Deserializing Receipts

For serializing and deserializing, you can use [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) which supports many encoding formats.
There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution here, but one option is:

`let bytes = bincode::serialize(&receipt);`

## Happy Building!

Hopefully, these guides and the [zkVM Quick Start] page will be sufficient for you to build your first [zkVM application]!

If you run into problems, don't be a stranger!
You can file an issue on [these docs] or the [examples], and we're happy to answer questions on [Discord].
