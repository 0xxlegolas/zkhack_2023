# zkVM Quick Start

Welcome to the [zkVM] Quick Start page! Here are the steps between you and your first proof:

1. Install the RISC Zero toolchain.
2. Initialize a new project using the [cargo risczero] tool.
3. Edit the boilerplate to build your first project.
4. Run your project locally or with [Bonsai].

## 1. Install the RISC Zero Toolchain

If you have already installed Rust via `rustup`, you can install our toolchain by running

```bash
cargo install cargo-risczero
cargo risczero install
```

If you need to install Rust or encounter problems, take a look at our [full installation instructions](./install.md).

## 2. Initialize a New Project

Once you've installed the toolchain, you can initialize a new project using the [starter template] by running:
[starter template]: https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/main/templates/rust-starter

```bash
cargo risczero new my_project
```

See the [cargo risczero] docs for other options for initialization.

## 3. Edit the boilerplate to build your first project

In the codebase for your new project, you'll find a handful of places marked `TODO`, where you'll need to make some changes in order to build your first project.

Don't worry -- each `TODO` comes with instructions for what you need to do, and the [Hello World tutorial] contains step-by-step instructions.

## 4. Run your project, locally or remotely

The readme for your project includes instructions for how to run it, both locally or remotely.
You can build your example and run the prover locally with:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

> **Congratulations!** <br/>_That's all it takes to build and run a minimal RISC Zero application._

## Local & Remote Proving

You can build and run your zkVM applications using your own hardware, or you can upload your [guest program] to [Bonsai] and make requests for proof generation as needed.

### Local Proving

To run the zkVM on your own machine, we recommend at least 16GB of RAM.
The readme files on the [zkVM demo applications] show `cargo` commands for local proof generation.

### Remote Proving

To run the zkVM remotely using [Bonsai], [request access] and set the environment variables `BONSAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>` and `BONSAI_API_URL=<BONSAI_URL>`.
Additional information is available in the [starter template](https://github.com/risc0/risc0/tree/main/templates/rust-starter#running-proofs-remotely-on-bonsai)

### Other options

Options such as GPU acceleration and skipping the proof generation are documented in the [feature flags].
