# Bonsai on Ethereum

_Warning: Bonsai is still in early development. Do not use in production._

Bonsai can be used as a [zk coprocessor] for Ethereum, allowing you to request and receive [verified proofs] directly from your smart contract.

At a high level, here's how it works:

<!-- TODO: Highlight the relay sections of this diagram -->

Our Bonsai-ETH Relay acts as a middle-man between your app contract and the Bonsai proving service. In order to use the Bonsai ETH Relay, dApp developers must have completed the following steps:

1. Deployed a [smart contract] on chain that calls the relay contract
2. Uploaded a compiled [program] for the zkVM to the Bonsai proving service

## Getting Started

The [Bonsai Foundry Template] is the best place to get started building Bonsai applications for Ethereum.
