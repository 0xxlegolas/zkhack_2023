# Hello World for the RISC Zero zkVM

Welcome!

This `hello-world` demo is a minimal application for the RISC Zero [zkVM], designed to help you get started building zkVM applications.

For a step-by-step guide to building your first zkVM application, we recommend [this tutorial].

## Quick Start

First, follow the [installation guide] if you don't already have the RISC Zero tools installed.

Then, run the example with:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

Congratulations! You just constructed a zero-knowledge proof that you know the factors of 391.

## Use Cases

Writing an application for the RISC Zero [zkVM] is the easiest way for software developers to produce zero-knowledge proofs.
Whether or not you're [building for blockchains], RISC Zero offers the most flexible and mature ecosystem for developing applications that involve ZKPs.

You can run the zkVM locally and your secrets will never leave your own machine, or you can upload your program & inputs to [Bonsai] for remote proving.

## Project Organization
zkVM applications are organized into a [host program] and a [guest program].
The host program can be found in [`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs) and the guest program can be found in [`methods/guest/src/main.rs`](methods/guest/src/main.rs).

The [host] first [executes] the guest program and then [proves the execution] to construct a [receipt].
The receipt can be passed to a third party, who can examine the [journal] to check the program's outputs and can [verify] the [receipt] to ensure the integrity of the [guest program]'s execution.

[host]: https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#host
[executes]: https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#execute
[guest program]: https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#guest-program
[host program]: https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#host-program
[proves the execution]: https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#prove
[receipt]: https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#receipt
[verify]: https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#verify
[journal]: https://dev.risczero.com/terminology#journal

### What gets proven?
The [receipt] proves that the [guest program] was executed correctly, and that the contents of `receipt.journal` match what was written by `env::commit()` during the execution of the guest program.

By running the demo, Alice demonstrates that she knows two integers that multiply to give the number written in `receipt.journal`.
Thus, Alice proves that the number written in `receipt.journal` is composite — and that she knows the factors — without revealing any further information.
