# XGBoost example

This example is meant to serve a guide for developers interested in using the RISC Zero for zkML applications using the popular XGBoost machine learning model. The model can be trained in Python and exported as a JSON file to into the RISC Zero zkVM.  Inference is computed within the guest code, allowing developers to submit a cryptoraphic receipt attesting to the correct execution of the trained model without revealing either the inputs or the model parameters. 

Model training takes place in a Python Jupyter Notebook using the XGBoost model from the Forust machine learning package.  The package is a pure Rust implementation of the XGBoost algorithm, complete with Python bindings.  This allowing developers to focus on data collection, feature engineering, and other machine learning related pre-processing tasks using all of the tools available in the Python machine learning ecosystem.  

The layout of this example is intended as a template for developers to train XGBoost models with their own data with minimal modifications to the host and guest code of the zkVM.

## Quick Start

First, [install Rust] if you don't already have it.

Next, install the `cargo-risczero` tool and install the toolchain with:
```bash
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-risczero
cargo risczero install
```

Then, run the example with:
```bash
cargo run --release
```
## Install Jupyter Notebook

Instructions for installing Jupyter Notebooks can be found here:  https://jupyter.org/install

## Running proofs remotely on Bonsai

_Note: The Bonsai proving service is still in early Alpha; an API key is
required for access. [Click here to request access][bonsai access]._

If you have access to the URL and API key to Bonsai you can run your proofs
remotely. To prove in Bonsai mode, invoke `cargo run` with two additional
environment variables:

```bash
BONSAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" BONSAI_API_URL="BONSAI_URL" cargo run
```

## Directory Structure

It is possible to organize the files for these components in various ways.
However, in this starter template we use a standard directory structure for zkVM
applications with the addition of a Python Jupyter notebook, which we think is a 
good starting point for your applications.
