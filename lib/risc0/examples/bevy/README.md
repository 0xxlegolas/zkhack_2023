# Bevy Game Engine Example

This code demonstrates a minimal example of how to use the [bevy] game engine inside the RISC Zero [zkVM].

[zkVM]: https://dev.risczero.com/zkvm
[bevy]: https://bevyengine.org/

## Quick Start

First, follow the [installation guide] if you don't already have the RISC Zero tools installed.

Then, run the example with:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Use Cases
By using this demo as part of a [Bonsai application], you could build an app where on-chain payment depends on off-chain gameplay.
To learn more about this use case, check out our Twitter thread about using Bonsai as a [zk coprocessor].

To link gameplay to a particular player, you may want to pair this demo with the [ECDSA] demo, which would allow a player to sign their moves.

## Project Organization

zkVM applications are organized into a [host program] and a [guest program].
The host program can be found in [`src/main.rs`] and the guest program can be found in [`methods/guest/src/main.rs`].

The [host] first [executes] the guest program and then [proves the execution] to construct a [receipt].
The receipt can be passed to a third party, who can examine the [journal] to check the program's outputs and can [verify] the [receipt] to ensure the integrity of the [guest program]'s execution.
